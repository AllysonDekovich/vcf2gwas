This directory contains the results of a comparison between vcf2gwas, easyGWAS and Hail.

The comparison was conducted by using a mouse dataset consisting of ~12,000 SNPs, 19 chromosomes, 1940 individuals.
Two phenotypes were used for the analyses.

The genotype file (mouse_hs1940.vcf.gz) and the phenotype file (mouse_hs1940.csv) can be found in the "dataset" subdirectory.
 
Each subdirectory includes the documentation of the analysis (.txt file or .py file) as well as manhattan plots for each phenotype.
